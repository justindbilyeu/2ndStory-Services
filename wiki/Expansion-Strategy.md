# Expansion Strategy

Three add-on lines that leverage the pilot’s labor + safety backbone:
1. **Site Prep** — cleanup, staging, final cleans
2. **Fence** — temp panels, gates, windscreens (monthly renewal option)
3. **Erosion** — silt fence, wattles, inlet protection (inspection/maintenance)

## 6-Month Roadmap (post-pilot)
| Month | Milestone | Proof / Gate |
|------:|-----------|--------------|
| 1–2 | Stabilize pilot metrics; document SOPs | ≥20% installer-hour reduction or ≥15% jobs/month |
| 2–3 | Launch Site Prep small trials | 3 paid cleanups; on-time delivery ≥95% |
| 3–4 | Fence install pilot via rental partner | 5 installs; zero safety incidents |
| 4–6 | Erosion control pilot | 3 installs + 2 rain-event maintenances |

## Service Line Targets (planning)
- **Site Prep:** 30–45% GM (route batching)  
- **Fence:** Install + monthly rental renewals; low inventory loss  
- **Erosion:** $/LF + maintenance; compliance proof photos
