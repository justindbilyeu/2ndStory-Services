# Funding & Incentives (2nd Story Services)

## Now (Simple & Real)
- **WOTC:** Per-hire tax credits; add Form 8850 to onboarding; submit to TWC within 28 days; track hours 120/400; file Form 5884 at tax time.
- **Partner Talking Point:** “Each successful hire may generate $2,400–$9,600 in federal tax credits we reinvest into supports.”

## Queue (After Pilot Data)
- **Apprenticeship registration:** 2–3 months. Then per-apprentice refunds.
- **TX Skills Development Fund:** Needs ACC (or similar) partnership; submit with pilot outcomes.

## Tools
- Repo: `tools/grants/grant_tracker.py`  
- Data: `data/grant-opportunities.csv`, `data/funding-summary.md` (export)  
- Tracking: `data/wotc-tracking.csv`  
- SOP: `operations/hiring/WOTC-checklist.md`

## Language to Use (External)
- “Federal **tax credits** (not cash grants) captured and **reinvested** into supports.”
- Avoid referral ‘bounties’—offer periodic, outcomes-tied **donations** to partner programs instead.
