# 2nd Story Services - Master Execution Checklist

This master checklist packages every deliverable required to launch, run, and close the first three pilot weeks. Owners should work phase-by-phase and update status daily in the shared tracker so that site leadership, operations, and partners stay aligned.

---

## Phase 1 — Pilot Mobilization (Weeks 1–2)

**Objectives**
- Confirm scope, crew composition, and partner commitments.
- Lock logistics (transport, tools, materials, housing) with written confirmations.
- Publish pilot communication plan and kickoff schedule.

**Checklist**
- [ ] Finalize pilot charter (objectives, constraints, success definition) and circulate for sign-off.
- [ ] Confirm participant roster, onboarding dates, and HR compliance steps.
- [ ] Secure vendor agreements (transport, lodging, disposal/dumpster, meals) and upload to repo contracts folder.
- [ ] Schedule toolbox talk template review + incident process walkthrough with field leads.
- [ ] Draft daily field handoff checklist and print copies for week 1 crews.
- [ ] Publish kickoff agenda + invite list (ops, field, partners) with prep notes.

**Metrics Touchpoints**
- Baseline crew readiness survey response rate ≥ 90%.
- Kickoff attendance target ≥ 95% of roster.

**Contingency Actions**
- If vendor unavailable, escalate to procurement list within 24 hours and document alternative plan.
- If compliance requirements slip, assign dedicated owner and update status board twice daily.

## Phase 2 — Crew & Site Readiness (Weeks 2–3)

**Objectives**
- Stage the pilot site, materials, and safety systems.
- Train crew leads on reporting, communication, and escalation paths.

**Checklist**
- [ ] Conduct site walk with safety + ops, documenting hazards and mitigation steps.
- [ ] Verify tool inventory (qty, condition) and stage replacements.
- [ ] Confirm transport routes, pickup windows, and contingency driver list.
- [ ] Run safety drill + incident escalation simulation with crew leads.
- [ ] Post daily communication cascade (morning huddle → midday update → evening recap).
- [ ] Upload updated site map, hazard log, and emergency contacts to wiki.

**Metrics Touchpoints**
- Site readiness checklist completion ≥ 95%.
- Safety drill participation rate 100% of crew leads.

**Contingency Actions**
- If hazard mitigation incomplete, flag in daily standup and assign closure owner by end of day.
- If tool inventory below minimums, trigger procurement order and note ETA in tracker.

## Phase 3 — Live Pilot Operations (Weeks 3–6)

**Objectives**
- Execute daily work plan while capturing data and feedback.
- Maintain tight feedback loop between field, ops, and partners.

### Daily Routine
- 05:30 – Transport check-in: confirm vehicle availability, drivers, and crew roster.
- 06:00 – Crew muster & stretch: safety briefing, work assignments, weather review.
- 11:30 – Midday pulse: crew lead submits progress photo + short form via mobile app.
- 15:30 – Closeout walkthrough: verify production targets, punch list, material reorder needs.
- 17:00 – Debrief huddle: capture safety observations, blockers, and wins; assign follow-ups.
- 18:00 – Data sync: upload production metrics, incidents, and attendance to dashboard.

### Field Support Cadence
- Ops lead checks in with crew leads twice daily (AM + PM) for risk review.
- Partner liaison receives daily recap email and flags external dependencies.

### Contingency Actions
- Missed production targets: trigger root cause review within 12 hours and log corrective actions.
- Safety incident: execute incident process checklist, notify leadership within 30 minutes, file report in repo.
- Weather disruption: activate alternate indoor tasks or reschedule using contingency calendar.

## Phase 4 — Performance Measurement & Iteration (Weeks 4–8)

**Objectives**
- Track performance, quality, and safety metrics to inform adjustments.
- Run weekly synthesis to prioritize improvements for subsequent weeks.

### Metrics to Track Daily
- Production units completed vs. target (by crew and cumulative).
- Rework hours logged vs. planned (<5% of total labor).
- Safety observations logged (goal ≥ 2 per crew per day) and corrective actions closed.
- Attendance & punctuality (on-time arrival ≥ 98%).
- Tool / material stockouts (zero tolerance; log incident if occurs).

### Weekly Synthesis
- Compile dashboard snapshot with trend lines for production, quality, safety, and attendance.
- Summarize top 3 wins, top 3 issues, and actions taken/required.
- Validate vendor performance (transport, disposal, housing) and escalate gaps.
- Update leadership brief with recommendations for next-week adjustments.

### Contingency Actions
- If any metric misses threshold 2 consecutive days, convene rapid response huddle and assign owner.
- If vendor SLA breach occurs, engage backup vendor and document in contingency tracker.

## Phase 5 — Closeout & Scale Readiness (Weeks 8–12)

**Objectives**
- Capture lessons learned, finalize documentation, and prepare for scale.
- Validate readiness to transition from pilot to steady-state operations.

**Checklist**
- [ ] Conduct final site inspection and close punch list items.
- [ ] Archive daily logs, safety reports, and dashboards in structured folders.
- [ ] Facilitate retrospective workshop (field, ops, partners) with action register.
- [ ] Update SOPs based on pilot learnings and publish revisions.
- [ ] Deliver final report to leadership with metrics summary, ROI analysis, and recommendations.

### Final Checkpoint
- Confirm all corrective actions closed with owners + completion dates.
- Ensure wiki + repo documentation reflects final SOPs and checklists.
- Obtain leadership go/no-go decision for next market expansion.

---

## Repo & Wiki Updates (All Phases)
- Sync new or revised SOPs to `ops/sop/` and mirror links in `wiki/`.
- Tag updates with date + owner in commit messages for traceability.
- Maintain change log noting which crews received updated procedures.

## Contingency Plans Summary
- Maintain centralized contingency tracker listing trigger, owner, and backup plan for logistics, staffing, and safety events.
- Review contingency status during weekly synthesis; escalate unresolved risks to leadership.

## Reporting & Communication
- Daily: update dashboard, circulate recap email, and log issues in tracker.
- Weekly: host pilot steering check-in, review metrics, and align on adjustments.
- Monthly: compile executive summary covering performance, financials, and readiness to scale.
