# 2nd Story Services - Competitive Positioning

*Why We’re First to Market in Texas*

## The Market Gap We’re Filling

### What Currently Exists in Texas

**Category 1: Traditional “Veteran-Friendly” Employers**

- Companies like Texas Veterans Construction hire veterans
- Standard for-profit operations with veteran hiring preference
- No workforce development infrastructure
- No systematic approach to barriers-to-employment populations
- **Gap:** Hiring preference ≠ workforce development program

**Category 2: Government Workforce Programs**

- Texas Veterans Commission, Texas Workforce Commission
- Provide training, placement support, tax credit facilitation
- Support employers who hire, but don’t provide services themselves
- **Gap:** They need employer partners - that’s us

**Category 3: Nonprofit Workforce Training**

- Austin Recovery, Salvation Army, other recovery programs
- Catholic Charities nationally runs construction trades training
- Focus on skills development, then placement elsewhere
- **Gap:** Training without integrated employment pathway

**Category 4: General “Second Chance” Employers**

- Construction companies willing to hire from reentry populations
- No dedicated model, just openness to these workers
- Often informal, case-by-case basis
- **Gap:** Willingness ≠ systematic workforce development

### What Doesn’t Exist (Our Opportunity)

**NO ONE in Texas is operating:**

- Professional construction services company
- Built specifically as workforce development platform
- Serving recovery + veterans + women simultaneously
- Capturing tax credits and grants systematically
- Providing actual customer-facing services (not just internal training)

**Result:** There’s demand (workforce programs need employer partners, roofing companies need labor) but no supply (dedicated service providers with this model).

We’re not entering a crowded market. **We’re creating a new category.**

## Why 2nd Story Is Uniquely Positioned

### 1. Insider + Outsider Perspective

**The QC Advantage:**

- I see the inefficiency daily: specialists doing grunt work
- I know exact time/cost per job (not theoretical)
- I understand quality requirements (I enforce them)
- I have credibility with owners (they trust my operational judgment)

**The Recovery Connection:**

- Personal history with Austin recovery programs (worked at two locally)
- Understand the population’s real barriers (not academic knowledge)
- Existing relationships with program directors (faster partnership building)
- Can manage with empathy AND accountability (crucial balance)

**The Combination:**
Most workforce development people don’t understand construction operations.
Most construction people don’t understand workforce development.
**I speak both languages fluently.**

### 2. Triple-Threat Value Proposition

We’re not selling just a social mission. We’re solving three problems simultaneously:

**For Roofing Companies (Our Customers):**

- Efficiency: Specialists focus on installation (20-40% time savings)
- Compliance: Fully documented W-2 labor (reduced regulatory risk)
- Differentiation: Mission-driven story (premium pricing justification)
- Capacity: More jobs with same install crews (15-20% increase possible)

**For Workers (Our Employees):**

- Immediate employment: Start Monday, get paid Friday
- Skill development: OSHA training, construction experience, pathway to crew lead
- Support structure: Transportation, flexible scheduling, case manager coordination
- Real wages: $18-20/hr entry, $25-30/hr lead (not charity wages)

**For Partner Organizations (Our Pipeline):**

- Placement success: Structured employment for their clients
- Funding leverage: Tax credits we capture can support their programs
- Outcome metrics: Employment data they can report to funders
- Referral pathway: Clear process, regular communication, mutual accountability

Most social enterprises optimize for one stakeholder. We create value for all three.

### 3. Financial Infrastructure (The Hidden Moat)

We’re building what no competitor has:

**Tax Credit Capture System:**

- WOTC setup from day one (Form 8850 in every hiring packet)
- $100K+ potential Year 1 from tax credits alone
- TWC Skills Development Fund partnership with ACC (targeting $200K)
- Apprenticeship registration for $2,500 per worker tax refunds

**Grant Pipeline:**

- Tracking 8 major opportunities worth $350K+ annually
- Active monitoring for new federal/state programs
- Application infrastructure ready (not scrambling when opportunities arise)
- Partnership relationships that unlock collaborative grants

Most “second chance” employers treat hiring as charity.
We treat it as a margin-improving business strategy backed by federal/state incentives.

### 4. Scalable Multi-Population Model

Starting with three populations gives us optionality:

**Phase 1 Learning:**

- Which population has best retention? (Scale that one)
- Which partnerships are most reliable? (Deepen those)
- Which services work best for which population? (Optimize matching)

**Phase 2 Expansion:**

- Women-led site prep crews (different service, same model)
- Justice-involved population added when we have track record
- Youth apprenticeships when we can provide mentorship infrastructure

**Phase 3 Replication:**

- License model to other cities (San Antonio, Houston, Dallas)
- Franchise to other trades (HVAC prep, electrical site work, landscaping)
- Platform approach: we become the infrastructure for workforce development in construction

We’re not building a single-population charity employment program.
We’re building a multi-sided marketplace platform that happens to start with roofing.

## The Category We’re Creating

### Traditional Construction: “Hire whoever shows up”

- Gray-market labor (undocumented, cash-paid, compliance risk)
- High turnover, inconsistent quality
- No workforce development infrastructure
- Regulatory exposure

### Traditional Social Enterprise: “Employment as charity”

- Mission-driven but often unprofitable
- Grant-dependent, not self-sustaining
- Limited scalability
- Workers get jobs but not necessarily careers

### 2nd Story Model: “Workforce Development as Competitive Advantage”

- Professional services with mission integration
- Tax credit and grant capture makes economics work
- Scalable across populations and geographies
- Workers get careers, customers get better service, we get sustainable business

**We’re the first in Texas to prove this model works in construction.**

-----

## Competitive Advantages (Why They Can’t Copy Us Easily)

### 1. First-Mover Advantage

- Partner relationships take 6-12 months to build
- WOTC/grant infrastructure takes months to set up
- Safety training and crew management systems are learned, not bought
- Brand positioning as “the workforce development construction company” is ours to lose

### 2. Personal Credibility Moat

- Recovery community trust (earned through lived experience, not purchased)
- Quality control expertise (years of field experience)
- Operational knowledge (I’ve done every job I’m asking workers to do)
- Owner relationships (internal champion, not outside consultant)

### 3. Knowledge Capture

- Every pilot job teaches us something competitors have to learn from scratch
- Worker retention patterns inform our support systems
- Partnership learnings accelerate future expansion
- Tax credit optimization improves with each hire

### 4. Network Effects

- More workers → more tax credits → more funding for support → better retention → more workers
- More partner orgs → larger candidate pool → better matching → higher success rates → stronger partnerships
- More customers → higher volumes → better crew utilization → lower costs → competitive pricing

## Market Timing: Why Now

### 1. Labor Crisis in Construction

Austin roofing companies are desperate for reliable labor. The gray-market approach is increasingly risky (ICE actions, compliance scrutiny, insurance issues).

**Our timing:** We offer documented, compliant labor exactly when the market needs it most.

### 2. Workforce Development Funding Boom

Federal and state programs are expanding. WOTC extended through 2025. TWC Skills Fund has record funding. TVC just distributed $44M in veteran grants.

**Our timing:** We capture this funding wave while others are still learning the programs exist.

### 3. ESG/Social Impact Demand

Corporate and government buyers increasingly require diversity hiring, veteran employment, ESG compliance from vendors.

**Our timing:** We’re the solution to their mandate, not a nice-to-have charity partner.

### 4. Recovery Community Maturity

Austin has robust recovery infrastructure (TOOF, Austin Recovery, Salvation Army, etc.) actively seeking employer partners for their clients.

**Our timing:** The pipeline exists. We just need to connect it to the market.

## The Pitch to Owners (Why This Matters to Them)

### Scenario 1: Keep It Internal (Their Benefit)

- Increase capacity 15-20% without hiring more installers
- Reduce compliance risk (fully documented labor)
- Access $100K+ in tax credits (improves margins)
- Market differentiation (premium pricing justification)
- You become the model other roofing companies study

### Scenario 2: Spin It Out (Their Benefit)

- Equity in a scalable platform business (not just roofing capacity)
- First client advantage (preferred pricing, priority scheduling)
- Proof of concept done on your projects (de-risked for you)
- Potential licensing revenue (if we replicate the model regionally)
- You’re founding partners in something potentially much bigger

### Either Way, You Win

The pilot proves value to your business first. The scale decision comes later, based on data. But you’re positioned at the center of it either way.

-----

## What We Need to Prove (The Pilot)

**4 jobs. 3 weeks. Clear metrics.**

### Success Looks Like:

- 20%+ time savings for install crews (or 15%+ capacity increase)
- 80%+ worker retention through pilot
- Zero safety incidents
- Positive customer feedback
- Tax credit capture process working smoothly

### If We Prove That:

- Internal expansion is no-brainer (you save money and time)
- Market expansion is viable (other roofing companies will want this)
- Investor interest is real (we have proof, not just theory)
- We’re not first to market anymore - we’re already IN market

-----

## The Bottom Line

**We’re not competing with anyone. We’re creating a new category:**

“Professional construction services that solve labor inefficiency while providing systematic workforce development for barriers-to-employment populations, capturing federal/state incentives to make the economics work.”

**No one in Texas is doing this.**
**No one in construction nationally is doing this at scale.**
**We have the expertise, relationships, and timing to be first.**

The question isn’t “can we compete?”
The question is “how fast can we scale before someone copies us?”

And the answer starts with 4 jobs in late October.

-----

*This isn’t a social mission with questionable economics.*
*This isn’t a business opportunity with a mission slapped on.*
*This is both, fully integrated, first-to-market in Texas.*

**That’s 2nd Story Services.**
