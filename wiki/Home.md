# 2nd Story Services — Wiki
*Elevating roofing operations, empowering second chances*

Welcome! This wiki is a high-level overview. Working docs live in the repo.

## What We're Building
**Workforce Model:** Pilot employs candidates from the recovery community, transitioning veterans, and women overcoming barriers (with planned expansion to reentry and youth apprenticeships).
