# 2nd Story Services
*Elevating roofing operations, empowering second chances*

## Vision
Create a specialized tear-off and site preparation service staffed by individuals from Austin's recovery community, solving labor inefficiency in residential roofing while providing meaningful employment and workforce reentry opportunities.

## Current Status
🔍 **Validation Phase** — Gathering insurance data, partner feedback, market scan, and internal QC baselines.

## The Opportunity
**Problem**
- Roofing companies pay specialist rates for non-specialist work (tear-off, site prep)
- Austin market faces labor compliance scrutiny
- Recovery community needs structured employment pathways
- 25–35% of job time is often spent on tear-off by overqualified crews

**Solution**
- Dedicated tear-off/prep crews (documented, trained)
- Specialists arrive to clean, job-ready sites; work 30–40% faster
- Mission-driven positioning → market differentiation and compliance edge

**Market (Austin, TX)**
- 200–500 roofing contractors
- Heavy reliance on undocumented labor (risk)
- Premium segment supports mission-driven providers
- No specialized tear-off provider at scale

## Two-Phase Approach
**Phase 1 — Internal Pilot (90 days)**
- Partner with current employer (Austin roofing company)
- 4–5 workers + 1 crew lead (OSHA-10)
- 20–25 jobs; track labor/time/quality/safety/disposal

**Phase 2 — Market Scale (If successful)**
- Standalone service to the Austin roofing market
- First right to invest/partner for current employer
- Target 20–50 contractor clients

## Roadmap
