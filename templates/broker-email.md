Subject: Quote Request — Workers’ Comp & GL for 2nd Story Services (Austin, TX)

Hi [Broker Name],

I’m launching a 90-day pilot called **2nd Story Services** supporting construction sites in Austin. We need quotes and class code confirmation for:

1) Roofing Support — tear-off & site prep (no installation)
2) Site Prep — general cleanup
3) Fence & Erosion — temp fencing, silt fence, wattles, inlet protection

Attached: our **Broker Brief** with scope, safety, and specific questions.

Could you provide:
- Applicable **NCCI class codes** and **rate per $100 payroll** for each service
- Any **safety discounts** (OSHA-10/30, formal program) we can target
- Options for including/excluding independent contractors
- Typical **limits** expected by municipal/commercial clients
- A draft **COI/endorsement** list

Happy to use a hypothetical payroll figure if needed to model premiums.

Thanks so much,
Justin Bilyeu
