### TOOF Call Script

"Hi Chase, it’s Justin with 2nd Story Services. I emailed this morning about locking in the modular units we scoped with your team. Just wanted to see if you had a few minutes this week to confirm the implementation timeline and any site updates. Happy to resend the cost sheet before we talk. What does your availability look like?"

### TVC Call Script

"Hi Katharine, Justin from 2nd Story Services here. I sent a quick note about the tiny home village plan and wanted to follow up. We’ve got the suppliers queued up to hit the six-week delivery window once we get your go-ahead. Do you have time this week to walk through funding approvals and permitting so we can keep things on track?"
