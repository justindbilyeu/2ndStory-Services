# Battlecard — Small GCs

## What they care about
- CO readiness, documentation trail, predictable site turnover.
- Multi-trade coordination, safety artifacts, fewer client escalations.

## Value props
- **Clean turnover:** photo-QC package (before/after), signed acceptance.  
- **Compliance-first:** W-2, workers comp, OSHA-10 lead, toolbox logs archived.  
- **Scope fit:** demo/cleanup, temp fencing, erosion basics (Phase 2).

## Discovery prompts
- “Where do closeouts slip—demo, cleanup, or handoff?”  
- “What docs do you require from subs at turnover?”  
- “If we owned pre-punch cleanup + erosion checks, what changes?”

## Proof points to bring
- Sample photo-QC set, toolbox talk log, handoff checklist, schedule adherence metric.

## Objections
- **“We already have a demo sub.”** Keep them. Use us for roofing-specific prep and final cleans with documentation.  
- **“Safety burden?”** We bring OSHA-led supervision + logs; lowers your admin.

## Close
“Give us a **pilot lot**: demo + site prep + photo-QC. If we don’t improve your punch predictability, no further commitment.”
