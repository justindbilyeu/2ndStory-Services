# Executive Summary
Hiring Our Heroes (HOH) coordinates DoD SkillBridge-style fellowships and corporate fellow placements for transitioning service members and spouses. Austin’s cohort is over-subscribed for tech placements, leaving trades partners in demand. We have a soft intro from the Monday playbook notes, but Sarah asked for a refined onramp before committing. Deliver the 2-hour work-readiness day plan and show how we bridge from fellowship to paid roles to convert the opportunity.

## Contact Card
- **Primary:** Sarah Kim — Austin Program Manager (sarah.kim@uschamber.com)
- **Secondary:** CPT Daniel Ruiz — Fort Cavazos Installation Liaison (daniel.ruiz@army.mil)
- **Decision cadence:** Cohort review Fridays at 10am.
- **Preferred channel:** Email brief with attachment; follow with LinkedIn message if no reply in 48 hours.

## Current Focus
- Filling November SkillBridge cohort slots for construction/trades employers.
- Coordinating Austin-area site visits for spouses interested in facilities roles.
- Aligning with Fort Cavazos transition office on required paperwork (DD-2648, MOUs).

## Employment Program Details
- Intake / referral steps: Submit employer interest form → share training outline → sign MOU → candidates matched 30 days prior to cohort start.
- Candidate profile: E-4 to E-7 separating soldiers + spouses; many with logistics, engineering, supply backgrounds; must meet DoD SkillBridge eligibility.
- Support services: Fellowship coaching, mentorship circles, installation transition counselors, resume + interview workshops.
- Incentives / funding: DoD covers salary during SkillBridge; HOH offers marketing amplification and spouse fellowship grants.

## Our Angle
- Package a 12-week fellowship: Weeks 1–2 onboarding (2-hour work-readiness day + OSHA), Weeks 3–8 field rotations, Weeks 9–12 leadership shadowing.
- Highlight transportation plan + daily pickup windows to reassure HOH about punctuality.
- Offer to host an Austin trades touchpoint with Fort Cavazos counselor present.

## Talking Points
- “We have room for two SkillBridge fellows in November with defined supervision—can we review the MOU this week?”
- “Our 2-hour work-readiness day doubles as the spouse orientation; we’ll share agendas in advance.”
- “Happy to align on privacy expectations—our roster will only use last initials until post-placement.”

## Language Snippets
> “We built the fellowship to mirror military structure: clear squads, daily briefs, and measurable milestones into assistant crew lead roles.”

## Risk / Privacy
- Must comply with DoD data handling; use encrypted storage for any PII.
- HOH sensitive to marketing claims—run any public statements through Sarah first.

## Timing
- Key windows: Friday cohort review; Fort Cavazos office hours Tuesday afternoons; November cohort start (Nov 18).
- Follow-up rhythm: Send draft MOU Monday, LinkedIn touch Wednesday, confirm agenda Friday morning before review.

## Fallback Path
- If Sarah is unresponsive, coordinate with CPT Daniel Ruiz for installation approval and request he loop Sarah back in.
