**Subject:** Next Tuesday crew slots + transport plan

Hi Chris,

Thanks again for looping us into the Monday playbook thread. We can take 3–4 residents next week and run them through our OSHA warmup huddle on Monday at 9am (we’ll host it onsite at Esperanza if that helps). After the huddle, we’ll lock in Tues/Thu tear-off shifts with guaranteed $18/hr daily pay and shared supervision from our crew lead.

Could we grab 15 minutes after your leadership standup on Monday to finalize the referral steps inside your Monday board and confirm the transport pickup window? I’ll send over the draft roster template as soon as you give the green light.

Appreciate you, and excited to get this moving.
