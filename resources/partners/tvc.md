# Executive Summary
Texas Veterans Commission (TVC) manages the statewide employer network for transitioning service members and veteran spouses. The Austin office is refreshing its employer listings ahead of a November hiring push. We have a warm introduction via the Monday playbook thread and can secure a featured listing plus a dedicated liaison if we provide a clear ladder from crew roles into leadership.

## Contact Card
- **Primary:** Marcus Johnson — Veterans Employer Liaison (marcus.johnson@tvc.texas.gov)
- **Secondary:** Alicia Herrera — Employment Services Manager (alicia.herrera@tvc.texas.gov)
- **Decision cadence:** Employer services sync every Wednesday at 2pm.
- **Preferred channel:** Email with attached one-pager; follow with Teams invite.

## Current Focus
- Filling employer slots for the November Veterans Career Fair in Austin.
- Highlighting employers that offer OSHA training and rapid advancement.
- Building liaison matches for employers willing to report weekly placement data.

## Employment Program Details
- Intake / referral steps: Submit employer intake form → review call with liaison → add jobs to WorkInTexas.com → weekly check-ins during first 30 days.
- Candidate profile: Recently separated service members, Guard/Reserve, spouses seeking stable schedules; many with logistics, engineering, or maintenance backgrounds.
- Support services: Resume labs, interview coaching, transportation vouchers for first week, connections to VA benefits.
- Incentives / funding: Access to On-the-Job Training (OJT) reimbursement and potential WOTC filings; TVC can underwrite SkillBridge-style pilots if structured.

## Our Angle
- Position Crew 1 as an OSHA-led pathway with defined tiers (Crew Member → Assistant Lead → Lead within 90 days).
- Offer to co-host a “work-readiness day” as the tryout component and share attendance data with TVC weekly.
- Request inclusion on the Veterans Career Fair employer list and cross-promote our 2-hour onboarding huddles.

## Talking Points
- “We have immediate openings for three veteran crew members with OSHA mentorship—can we lock in a listing this week?”
- “We’re piloting a 2-hour work-readiness day; TVC candidates can attend and convert straight into paid shifts.”
- “Happy to send weekly retention metrics so your team can tout wins to leadership.”

## Language Snippets
> “Our crews mirror the chain-of-command veterans expect: clear roles, OSHA-certified leads, and a fast track to leadership stipends.”

## Risk / Privacy
- Ensure EEOC-compliant language on listings; TVC prefers gender-neutral and disability-inclusive phrasing.
- Data sharing: only send aggregate retention numbers unless veteran signs release.

## Timing
- Key windows: Employer services sync (Wed 2pm), Veterans Career Fair marketing drop (Oct 18), SkillBridge planning cycle (Q1 FY26).
- Follow-up rhythm: Email intake Monday AM, confirm on Wednesday sync, send metrics each Friday.

## Fallback Path
- If Marcus is unavailable, route through Alicia Herrera and offer a quick 15-minute huddle to finalize the listing copy.
