### The Other Ones Foundation (TOOF)

**Subject:** Re: TOOF x 2nd Story — launch timing for transitional housing

Hi Chase,

Happy Monday! We’re lining up this week’s outreach checklist and wanted to see if TOOF is ready to lock in next steps on the modular units we scoped last quarter. We still have the configuration that pairs 18 sleeping pods with the shared service core you liked, and the production window we held is still open if we release the PO by the end of the month.

Could we set 20 minutes this week to review the implementation schedule and confirm any site updates on your side? I can send over the revised cost sheet beforehand so you have the latest pricing on the utility skids and on-site assembly.

Let me know which day works best and I’ll send a calendar invite. Appreciate you, Chase!

Best,
Justin

### The Village Collaborative (TVC)

**Subject:** Quick touchpoint on Village Collaborative build-out

Hi Katharine,

Hope your week is off to a strong start. I’m touching base on the transitional tiny home village concept we mapped out with your operations team. We tightened the supply chain plan so that we can deliver the first 12 units inside of a six-week window once we get the green light.

Do you have availability this week for a short call to align on funding approvals and make sure the permitting path is still clear? Happy to send the updated milestone tracker in advance so you can share it internally.

Thanks again for the collaboration—excited to keep momentum going.

Warmly,
Justin
