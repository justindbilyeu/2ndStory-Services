# Founding Partner Call Script (60 Seconds)

**Opening (0:00–0:15)**  
"Hey [Name], it’s [Your Name] with 2nd Story. We’re helping top roofing crews hand off clean decks so your installers can roll right in. You have a quick minute?"

**Credibility & Hook (0:15–0:30)**  
"We’re working with installers who need day-of tear-off support that actually hits the schedule—clean deck, photos, and sign-off before lunch on a 30–35 square job. No gimmicks, just crews that show up, handle disposal, and hand you a ready roof."

**Offer & Differentiators (0:30–0:45)**  
"We’re inviting a few founding partners: milestone billing (85% at handoff, 15% after install-ready), today’s rate locked for 90 days, and you get priority AM slots as we scale."

**Close (0:45–1:00)**  
"If we can prove 90%+ on-time handoffs over the first 10 jobs, we keep booking. If not, we pause and tune together. How about we set a 20-minute working session to walk your ops lead through the checklist and penciling in your next installs?"

## Objection Handles

**“We already have crews.”**  
"Totally get it. Most partners do—the gap is consistent AM handoff with documentation. We plug in for surge capacity or when you need proof the deck’s ready before installers roll."

**“I don’t want to be locked into pricing.”**  
"No lock-in beyond the first handful of jobs. The 90-day rate hold just protects you from price creep while we prove value. You can throttle up or down anytime."

**“What if you miss the window?”**  
"We track on-time over a rolling 10-job window. If we slip below 90%, we pause together before you risk a crew sitting idle. That safeguard is in writing."

**“Can you handle steep or double-layer tear-offs?”**  
"Yes—with advance notice. We have tiered pricing for double-layer or steep-slope work so you know the adders before we schedule."
