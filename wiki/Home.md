# 2nd Story Services — Wiki
*Elevating roofing operations, empowering second chances*

Welcome! This wiki is a high-level overview. Working docs live in the repo.

## What We're Building
Our pilot deploys OSHA-led roofing support crews with a **three-population workforce model**: Recovery community members, transitioning veterans (and spouses), and women overcoming economic barriers or DV histories. Future expansion will add reentry, refugees/asylees, opportunity youth, and people with disabilities in partnership with TWC VR.

👉 See the full pipeline breakdown, outreach templates, and support requirements in [`resources/talent-pipelines.md`](../blob/main/resources/talent-pipelines.md).
