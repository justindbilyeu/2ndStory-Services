# 2nd Story Services — Competitive Positioning (polish)

*Why we’re a category-defining service in Texas*

## The gap
Today in Texas you’ll find:
- **Veteran-friendly employers** (hire preference, little workforce-dev infrastructure).  
- **Government programs** (TVC/TWC enablement; they need employer partners).  
- **Nonprofit training** (skills → placement elsewhere; no integrated service business).  
- **Ad-hoc “second chance” hiring** (case-by-case, not a system).

**What’s missing:** a professional **construction site-services company** intentionally built as a **workforce-development platform** (recovery + veterans + women) that **captures credits/grants** and delivers a **customer-facing SLA** (clean-deck handoff, photo-QC, documented, insured).

> As of Oct 4, 2025 we haven’t identified any Texas provider operating this integrated model at commercial scale; we’ll keep verifying as we grow.

## Why us (unfair advantages)
- **Field credibility:** QC perspective with real time/cost baselines and owner trust.  
- **Population expertise:** lived recovery connections + vetted partner pipeline.  
- **Financial infrastructure:** WOTC from day one; apprenticeship + Skills Fund on deck.  
- **Playbook, not vibes:** OSHA-led SOPs, photo-QC, milestone billing, retention supports.

## Triple-win value
- **Roofing/GC customers:** 20–40% installer time saved; documented, compliant labor; clean handoffs; capacity up 15–20%.  
- **Workers:** $18–20/hr entry; $25–30/hr leads; structure, training, transportation.  
- **Partners:** referrals turn into measurable employment outcomes + captured incentives.

## Proof today vs. to validate
**We can substantiate now:**  
- Documented labor + OSHA-led SOPs; photo-QC handoff; WOTC capture process; repo of SOPs and pilot metrics plan.

**Pilot will validate:**  
- ≥20% installer time savings, ≥80% 90-day retention, ≥90% on-time handoffs, positive unit economics.

## Positioning statement
For Austin roofing companies and small GCs losing margin to demo/prep with premium installers or inconsistent day labor, **2nd Story Services** provides **roof-specific tear-off & site-prep crews** with **compliance-first W-2 labor, OSHA-led safety, photo-QC, and a clean-deck handoff SLA**—while building a workforce-development pipeline (recovery, veterans, women) funded in part by credits/grants.

## Quick compare

| Attribute | 2nd Story | Day labor | General demo | Installers do tear-off |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Roofing-specific SOPs | **Yes** | Rare | Sometimes | N/A |
| W-2 + WC + OSHA lead | **Yes** | Mixed | Mixed | Yes |
| Clean-deck SLA + photo-QC | **Yes** | No | Rare | N/A |
| Mission/ESG value | **Yes** | No | No | No |
| Capacity unlocked | **High** | Unclear | Medium | Low |

## Landmine questions (to surface competitor gaps)
- “Do you provide **signed handoff + photo-QC** at turnover?”  
- “Are all workers **W-2 with workers comp** and an **OSHA-10 lead**?”  
- “What’s your **on-time handoff %** over your last 30 jobs?”

## Talk track (60 seconds)
“I run 2nd Story Services—OSHA-led tear-off & site-prep so your installers only install. We commit to a clean-deck handoff by [time window], with photo-QC and an installer sign-off. Fully documented W-2 crews (recovery, veterans, women), WOTC-funded to keep economics tight. 85/15 milestone billing and a 90-day rate lock for founding partners. Can we pencil two dates next week?”

## Objection handles
- **“Day labor’s cheaper.”** Cheaper hourly ≠ cheaper job. Our crews convert 25–35% of job time back to installation; that’s revenue time. Plus compliance, fewer callbacks, and photo-QC.  
- **“Will you actually show up?”** On-time handoff SLA, daily toolbox logs, and signed acceptance. We publish metrics.  
- **“Mission sounds risky.”** It’s a retention strategy, not charity—structure, training, case-manager support, documented safety. And WOTC offsets cost.

## Moat (what’s hard to copy)
Partner flywheel (TOOF/TVC, etc.), data exhaust (photo-QC, SLA, toolbox logs), documented SOPs, and first-mover brand in “workforce-dev site services.”
