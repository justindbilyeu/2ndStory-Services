**Subject:** Crew leadership track for Austin veterans — ready for listing

Hi Marcus,

Appreciate you looping us into the Monday intro. We’re ready to submit the employer intake this week and would love to confirm the listing copy on your Wednesday employer services sync. We can place three veteran crew members immediately with OSHA-led supervision and a defined path: Crew Member → Assistant Lead → Lead within 90 days (with stipend bumps at each rung).

Could you review the attached one-pager and let us know if anything needs tweaking for WorkInTexas? Happy to send weekly retention metrics so you can showcase outcomes. If it helps, we can also co-host a 2-hour work-readiness day next Thursday for any TVC candidates who want to see the crew in action.

Thanks for the partnership!
