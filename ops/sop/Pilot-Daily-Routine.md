# Pilot Daily Routine (Phase 3)

This routine is mirrored from the Master Execution Checklist and should be posted at the field office so crews and support staff stay aligned.

- **05:30 – Transport check-in:** confirm vehicle availability, drivers, and crew roster.
- **06:00 – Crew muster & stretch:** safety briefing, work assignments, weather review.
- **11:30 – Midday pulse:** crew lead submits progress photo + short form via mobile app.
- **15:30 – Closeout walkthrough:** verify production targets, punch list, material reorder needs.
- **17:00 – Debrief huddle:** capture safety observations, blockers, and wins; assign follow-ups.
- **18:00 – Data sync:** upload production metrics, incidents, and attendance to dashboard.

_Field support cadence: ops lead checks in with crew leads twice daily (AM + PM) for risk review; partner liaison receives daily recap email and flags external dependencies._
