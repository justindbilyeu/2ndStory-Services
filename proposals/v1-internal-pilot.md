# 2nd Story Services — Internal Pilot Proposal (90 Days)
[Paste the branded one-pager content here after owner review.]

## WORKFORCE MODEL: THREE-POPULATION PILOT
We’ll staff with **Recovery**, **Veterans**, and **Women** (site-prep/erosion emphasis).  
**Crew (5–6):** 2–3 Recovery · 1–2 Veterans · 1–2 Women · 1 OSHA-10+ Crew Lead.

**Why it strengthens the model:** diversified pipeline, WOTC/grants, triple-threat market story, same ops backbone.  
**Enhanced success metrics:** retention by population (30/60/90, target ≥80%), attendance reliability, incident rate/1,000 hrs, customer feedback, incentives captured.
