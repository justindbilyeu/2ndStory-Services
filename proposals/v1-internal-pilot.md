# 2nd Story Services — Internal Pilot Proposal (90 Days)
[Paste the branded one-pager content here after owner review.]

## WORKFORCE MODEL: THREE-POPULATION PILOT
We will staff the internal pilot with a blended workforce drawn from **Recovery**, **Veterans (including spouses)**, and **Women overcoming economic barriers or DV histories**. Each population brings unique strengths, and all will be supported through trauma-informed supervision, structured schedules, and coordinated case-management touchpoints.

**Crew Composition (5–6 total):**
- 2–3 Recovery community members (tear-off, site prep, cleanup focus)
- 1–2 Veterans or military spouses (crew lead pipeline, logistics, erosion control)
- 1–2 Women recruits (site prep, final cleanup, erosion inspection)
- OSHA-10+ Crew Lead (may be veteran track)

**Enhanced Success Metrics:**
- Retention and attendance by population at 30/60/90 days (target ≥80%)
- Daily safety observations and incident rate per 1,000 hours
- Case-manager coordination scorecard (response time, support satisfaction)
- Candidate pipeline throughput (≥2 reliable referrals per population/month)
- Incentive capture (WOTC, veteran grants, partner subsidies)

**Why it matters:** Diversifying the pilot talent mix strengthens operational resilience, unlocks funding incentives, and tells a mission-forward story for clients and investors without changing the core service model.
