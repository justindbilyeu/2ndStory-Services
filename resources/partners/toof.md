# Executive Summary
The Other Ones Foundation (TOOF) is scaling from day-pay encampment crews into contracted facility services and light construction. They need predictable work orders and a staffed referral path for participants exiting their shelter hotel. We can slot in as their go-to teardown + fencing partner with OSHA-led supervision while they stay focused on wraparound services.

## Contact Card
- **Primary:** Chris Baker — CEO (chris@toof.org)
- **Secondary:** Lindsay Powell — Workforce Director (lindsay@toof.org)
- **Decision cadence:** Monday leadership standup (8:30am)
- **Preferred channel:** Email intro → follow-up text the morning of meetings

## Current Focus
- Converting Esperanza residents into full-time crews with case management support.
- Standing up new South Austin worksite needing rapid-response tear-off crews.
- Securing partners who guarantee transport or onsite check-in to stabilize attendance.

## Employment Program Details
- Intake / referral steps: Case manager clears participant → adds to Monday spreadsheet → TOOF workforce coach confirms IDs and PPE.
- Candidate profile: 18+ adults in shelter hotels, mix of recovery and chronically unhoused talent; most have day-labor history.
- Support services: Daily stipends, showers, laundry, hot meals, onsite case management, harm reduction team.
- Incentives / funding: ESG funds from City of Austin + ARPA; willing to co-fund transportation if partner provides supervision.

## Our Angle
- Offer a 2-hour OSHA warmup huddle onsite Mondays, then deploy 3–4 person tear-off pods Tues–Thu with guaranteed $18/hr + daily pay.
- Provide shared crew lead so TOOF can keep case managers focused on stabilizing housing transitions.
- Map referral path into our Crew 1 roster with weekly feedback loop using their Monday dashboard.

## Talking Points
- “We can absorb 3–4 workers immediately with guaranteed shifts next Tuesday; can we lock a standup on Monday?”
- “Let’s draft the referral steps inside your Monday board so coaches know when to handoff.”
- “We’ll publish transport/pickup windows so your team can preload clients the night before.”

## Language Snippets
> “We’ll keep the work predictable: same call time, OSHA huddle, and daily pay. Your coaches stay focused on housing while we handle supervision.”

## Risk / Privacy
- Coordinate on HIPAA-light consent forms; TOOF prefers initials only on shared rosters.
- Sensitive to media coverage—confirm photography permissions before any site visit.

## Timing
- Key windows: Monday leadership standup; Tuesday/Thursday deployments aligned with existing city contracts.
- Follow-up rhythm: Send recap email Monday PM; text confirmation Tuesday 7am before transport departs.

## Fallback Path
- If Chris is slow to respond, work through Lindsay Powell and offer to pilot with a single 2-day tear-off at the South Austin site.
