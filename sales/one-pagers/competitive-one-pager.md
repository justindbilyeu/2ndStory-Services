# 2nd Story Services — Why Us (1-pager)

**Category:** Roofing-specific tear-off & site prep with compliance-first W-2 crews, OSHA-led, photo-QC, and clean-deck handoff SLA.

**Problem:** Installers burn 25–35% of job time on tear-off/cleanup; day-labor is unreliable and undocumented.

**Solution:** Dedicated prep crews that hand you a clean deck on schedule, with photo-QC and a signed acceptance. Installers only install.

**Proof now:** OSHA-led SOPs, photo-QC workflow, 85/15 billing, WOTC capture process.  
**Pilot will validate:** ≥20% installer time savings, ≥90% on-time handoffs, ≥80% 90-day retention, positive unit economics.

**Talk track (60s):**  
“I run 2nd Story—OSHA-led tear-off & site-prep so your installers only install. Clean-deck handoff by [time], photo-QC, installer sign-off. 85/15 billing, 90-day rate lock. Two dates next week?”

**Landmines:** signed handoff + photo-QC? W-2+WC? OSHA-10 lead? On-time % past 30 jobs?
