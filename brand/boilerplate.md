2nd Story Services delivers professional construction site services—roofing tear-off, site prep, cleanup, fencing, and erosion control—through OSHA-led crews staffed by people rebuilding their lives. We combine compliance-first operations (W-2, I-9/E-Verify, safety training) with a multi-population workforce model (recovery community, veterans, and women) to increase contractor capacity while creating pathways into the trades.
