# Owner Brief
**What:** Dedicated tear-off & site-prep crews so installers focus on installation.  
**Who:** OSHA-trained, documented workers from Austin’s recovery community.  
**Why now:** Faster schedules, stronger compliance, real community impact.

## Pilot (90 days)
- Crew: 1 OSHA-10 lead + 4–5 workers
- Scope: 20–25 jobs alongside install crews
- Success: ≥20% fewer installer hours **or** ≥15% more jobs/month; QC/safety ≥ baseline; ≥80% retention

## Scale Path
- Internal: add crews → +15–20% capacity
- External: standalone service lines (Site Prep, Fence, Erosion)
