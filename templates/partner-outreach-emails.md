**Subject:** 2nd Story Services — Veteran Hiring Pathways (Crew Lead + Field Roles)

Hi [Name],

I’m Justin with 2nd Story Services in Austin. We run OSHA-forward roofing support crews (tear-off, fencing/erosion control, final cleanup) and are piloting a **veteran-forward hiring track** for transitioning service members and spouses.

**What we’re offering:**
- Safety-first crews with clear chain of command and daily toolbox talks
- Weekly pay, employer-provided PPE, and guaranteed transport to job sites
- Leadership pathway into crew lead roles (OSHA-10+ preferred; we’ll sponsor additional safety training)

Could we schedule a 15-minute call next week to walk through the pilot and align on referral criteria? We’re ready to start with **1–2 veteran candidates** in the next hiring wave.

Thanks for considering it, and please let me know if there’s a colleague I should loop in.

Respectfully,

Justin Bilyeu
