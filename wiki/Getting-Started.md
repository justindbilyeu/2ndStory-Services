# Getting Started (Internal)

## How we work
- Keep the repo **private** during the pilot.
- No PII in commits; use redactions where necessary.
- Open issues using templates (Task / Meeting Notes / Research).

## Branch & PR
- Branch names: `feat/...`, `chore/...`, `docs/...`
- 1 PR = 1 clear change. Request review before merging.

## Weekly Rhythm
- Update `data/pilot-metrics.csv`
- Post a weekly brief using `templates/owner-update-email.md`
- Log validations in `/validation/` (notes + links)
