# Site Services Expansion

Three add-on lines that leverage the pilot’s labor + safety backbone:
1) **Site Prep** — cleanup, staging, final cleans  
2) **Fence** — temp panels, gates, windscreens (monthly renewal option)  
3) **Erosion** — silt fence, wattles, inlet protection (inspection/maintenance)
