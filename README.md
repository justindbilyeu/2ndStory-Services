# 2nd Story Services
*Elevating roofing operations, empowering second chances*

[➡️ Project Wiki](https://github.com/justindbilyeu/2ndStory-Services/wiki) — overview for owners/partners

## Vision
Create a specialized tear-off and site prep service staffed by people rebuilding their lives — including community members in recovery, transitioning veterans (and spouses), and women overcoming economic barriers — delivering professional construction support with measurable community impact.

> **Multi-Population Pilot Model:** Recovery • Veterans • Women  \
> Future cohorts: Reentry • Refugees/Asylees • Opportunity Youth • People with Disabilities (TWC VR).  \
> See [`resources/talent-pipelines.md`](resources/talent-pipelines.md) for partner details and outreach scripts.

## Current Status
🔍 **Validation Phase** — Gathering insurance data, partner feedback, market scan, and internal QC baselines.

## The Opportunity
**Problem**
- Roofing companies pay specialist rates for non-specialist work (tear-off, site prep)
- Austin market faces labor compliance scrutiny
- Recovery community needs structured employment pathways
- 25–35% of job time is often spent on tear-off by overqualified crews

**Solution**
- Dedicated tear-off/prep crews (documented, trained)
- Specialists arrive to clean, job-ready sites; work 30–40% faster
- Mission-driven positioning → market differentiation and compliance edge

**Market (Austin, TX)**
- 200–500 roofing contractors
- Heavy reliance on undocumented labor (risk)
- Premium segment supports mission-driven providers
- No specialized tear-off provider at scale

## Two-Phase Approach
**Phase 1 — Internal Pilot (90 days)**
- Partner with current employer (Austin roofing company)
- 4–5 workers + 1 crew lead (OSHA-10)
- 20–25 jobs; track labor/time/quality/safety/disposal

**Phase 2 — Market Scale (If successful)**
- Standalone service to the Austin roofing market
- First right to invest/partner for current employer
- Target 20–50 contractor clients

### Divisions (Roadmap)
- Roofing Support (pilot): tear-off & site prep
- Site Prep: general cleanup, final cleans, material staging
- Fence & Erosion: temporary fencing, silt fence, wattles, inlet protection

## Roadmap
**Validation (current)**
- [ ] Insurance broker consultation (rates, codes, liability)
- [ ] Recovery center conversations (pipeline & supports)
- [ ] Competitive scan
- [ ] Internal QC data analysis

**Pilot Prep**
- [ ] Finalize pilot proposal & budget
- [ ] Secure partner MOUs
- [ ] Hire crew lead; safety protocols

**Pilot Execution**
- [ ] Complete 20–25 jobs
- [ ] Track metrics; customer feedback
- [ ] Cost & schedule performance

**Scale Decision**
- [ ] Go/No-Go; partner structure; rollout plan

## Core Values
**Dignity in Work · Safety First · Operational Excellence · Community Impact**
