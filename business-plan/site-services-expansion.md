# Site Services Expansion — 2nd Story Services

## Summary
Add three service lines that leverage the pilot’s labor + safety backbone:
1) General Cleanup / Site Prep
2) Temporary Fencing (panel install/remove; monthly renewals)
3) Erosion & Stormwater Control (silt fence, wattles, inlet protection)

## Why Now
- Same workforce profile; quick-train tasks
- Strong demand; underserved by small GCs/remodelers
- Recurring/monthly revenue (fence rentals, erosion maintenance)

## Market (Austin quick take)
- High residential/commercial build volumes
- GC pain point: cleanup reliability; erosion compliance
- Fencing renewals drive predictable cash flow

## Entry Costs (estimates placeholders)
- Cleanup kit (rakes, brooms, magnets, bins): $X
- Trailer + tie-downs: $X
- Fence inventory lease OR partner arrangement: $X
- Erosion materials per job (silt fence/ft, wattles, inlet): $X

## Pricing Models (draft)
- Cleanup: per visit or per project (rough/final)
- Fence: install + monthly rental; removal fee
- Erosion: $/linear ft + monthly inspection/maintenance

## Risks & Mitigations
- Scheduling clashes → central dispatch & route batching
- QC variability → SOPs + photos on completion
- Safety → OSHA-10 lead, daily checklist

## Next Steps
- Research 3 local comps for each line (pricing/lead times)
- Add SOPs & data logs
- Pilot a “Roofing + Cleanup” bundle with a friendly GC/roofer
