# Validation Hub

Centralize validation workstreams, point to live trackers, and keep experiments moving.

## Focus Areas
- **Insurance:** Start with the [[Insurance]] brief, then update rate math in [`/validation/insurance-sanity-check.md`](https://github.com/justindbilyeu/2ndStory-Services/blob/main/validation/insurance-sanity-check.md).
- **Field Research:** Capture calls and site visits in the [[Research Navigator]] so every question lands on a clear next step.
- **Pilot Ops:** Feed lessons into the [[Pilot Playbook]] and document changes in the [[Decision Log]].

## Templates & Logs
- Meetings → copy the template in [[Meeting Notes]] before each touchpoint.
- Decisions → log key calls in [[Decision Log]] (table + narrative).
- Experiments → archive results in [`/validation/README.md`](https://github.com/justindbilyeu/2ndStory-Services/blob/main/validation/README.md).
