**Subject:** Re: TOOF x 2nd Story — launch timing for transitional housing

Hi Chase,

Happy Monday! We’re lining up this week’s outreach checklist and wanted to see if TOOF is ready to lock in next steps on the modular units we scoped last quarter. We still have the configuration that pairs 18 sleeping pods with the shared service core you liked, and the production window we held is still open if we release the PO by the end of the month.

Could we set 20 minutes this week to review the implementation schedule and confirm any site updates on your side? I can send over the revised cost sheet beforehand so you have the latest pricing on the utility skids and on-site assembly.

Let me know which day works best and I’ll send a calendar invite. Appreciate you, Chase!

Best,
Justin
