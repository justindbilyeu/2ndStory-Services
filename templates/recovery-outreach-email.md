Subject: Quick input on a roofing tear-off pilot

Hi [Name] — I’m coordinating a 90-day pilot employing people in recovery for roofing tear-off/site prep (Austin). Could I get 20 minutes of your perspective on structure and supports that actually work early in recovery? If there’s a fit, we’d start with 4–5 candidates and a crew lead. Thanks — Justin.
