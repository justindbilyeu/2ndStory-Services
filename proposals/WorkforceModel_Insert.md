# Workforce Model — Three-Population Pilot

Staff the pilot with candidates from three high-promise pipelines — **Recovery**, **Veterans**, and **Women** — using one shared operational backbone: OSHA-led safety, structured schedules, and supportive supervision. This broadens hiring success, unlocks incentives, and strengthens market appeal without adding operational complexity.

## Population Fit Matrix
| Population | Best-fit roles | Support needs | Strategic value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Recovery | Tear-off, site prep, cleanup | Treatment/meeting flexibility; case-manager contact; transport | Authentic social-impact story; strong fit for physical outdoor work |
| Veterans | Crew-lead pipeline, fencing/erosion, logistics | PTSD/TBI awareness; clear chain of command; mission clarity | Leadership bench; veteran preference; potential WOTC eligibility |
| Women | Site prep, final cleanup, erosion inspection | Trauma-informed mgmt; privacy; childcare flexibility; PPE fit | Diversity differentiation; customer resonance; women-led crew PR |

## Pilot Crew & Metrics
**Crew (5–6):** 2–3 Recovery · 1–2 Veterans · 1–2 Women · 1 OSHA-10+ Crew Lead  
**Key metrics:** installer hours saved or jobs/month ↑; QC/safety at or above baseline; 30/60/90-day retention (target ≥80%); attendance reliability; incidents per 1,000 hrs; customer feedback; eligible incentives captured (e.g., WOTC).

## Operational Infrastructure (shared)
**Safety:** OSHA-10 lead; 5-minute daily toolbox talks; fall-protection where needed; anti-harassment code of conduct; PPE sized for all bodies.  
**Supports:** van route or bus-pass stipend; privacy protocols (esp. DV survivors); case-manager handshake; appointment flexibility.  
**Hiring:** I-9/E-Verify; WOTC pre-screen (Form 8850) at offer; background checks only when site-required; weekly pay (same-day available for stabilization).

## Why This Strengthens the Model
**Talent resilience:** diversified pipelines reduce recruiting risk.  
**Financial:** potential tax credits (WOTC), grant pathways, premium-pricing story.  
**Market:** triple-threat resonance — recovery, veterans, and women; opens ESG/govt-contract doors.  
**Same ops, bigger mission:** one backbone, tailored supports.
