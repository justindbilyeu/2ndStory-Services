**Clean-deck handoff (CDH):** Installer-ready deck at turnover. Includes: magnet sweep, nails pulled, decking status noted, debris removed. Documented with photo-QC; installer lead signs acceptance.

**SLA (Service Level Agreement):** Time window for CDH agreed at scheduling. We track on-time % (target ≥90% rolling 10 jobs).

**Photo-QC:** Standardized before/after shots (angles, elevations, penetrations) uploaded to repo and attached to handoff record.

**WOTC:** Work Opportunity Tax Credit. We include IRS Form 8850 at hire; credit is $2,400–$9,600 per eligible worker.

**OSHA-10 Crew Lead:** Every crew is supervised by an OSHA-10 certified lead who runs daily toolbox talks and hazard controls.

**85/15 billing:** 85% at accepted handoff, 15% at week-end reconciliation (or per agreement).

**Founding partner rate lock:** 90-day locked pricing for early customers; tied to a minimum job count.

**Claims discipline:**  
- We **will** claim: documented W-2 labor, OSHA-led safety, photo-QC, signed handoffs, WOTC process.  
- We **won’t** claim: “first ever” beyond our knowledge; we’ll say “as of Oct 4, 2025 we haven’t identified…” and keep verifying.
