# Battlecard — Roofing Owners (5–15 employees)

## ICP snapshot
- Owner-operator, 1–3 install crews, booked 2–4 weeks out.
- Pain: installers lose 25–35% of day to tear-off & cleanup; callbacks on sloppy prep.

## Core pains we solve
- **Capacity leak:** premium installers doing non-premium work.
- **Schedule slip:** tear-off overruns → missed installs.
- **Compliance risk:** ad-hoc labor, no documentation.
- **Quality variance:** nails left, deck damage, poor handoff.

## Discovery questions
1) “How often do installs start late because tear-off ran long?”  
2) “What % of job time do your installers spend on non-install tasks?”  
3) “Do you get photo documentation of deck condition before install?”  
4) “If I gave you **two clean decks next week**, would you fill them?”

## ROI math (example)
- Installer crew: 3 techs × $35/hr = **$105/hr** burdened.  
- Avg tear-off handled by installers: **5 hours**.  
- Saved installer time: 5 × $105 = **$525** value per job (plus 1 extra roof/week at scale).  
- **Net:** our fee vs. reclaimed install revenue → capacity > price delta.

## Landmines to set
- “Do your current tear-off guys provide **photo-QC + signed acceptance**?”  
- “Are they **W-2 with workers comp** and an **OSHA-10 lead**?”  
- “What’s their **on-time handoff %**?”

## Objections
- **“Day labor’s cheaper.”** Hourly, yes. Per job? No. We free installers to install; plus fewer callbacks.  
- **“Reliability?”** On-time SLA, toolbox logs, signed handoff. We publish metrics.  
- **“Mission risk?”** Structure + support reduces churn; WOTC offsets cost.

## Close
“Let’s pencil **two jobs next week**. 85/15 billing, 90-day rate lock, photo-QC & signed handoff.”
