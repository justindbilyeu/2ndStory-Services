# Pilot Metrics & Weekly Synthesis (Phase 4)

## Metrics to Track Daily
- Production units completed vs. target (by crew and cumulative).
- Rework hours logged vs. planned (<5% of total labor).
- Safety observations logged (goal ≥ 2 per crew per day) and corrective actions closed.
- Attendance & punctuality (on-time arrival ≥ 98%).
- Tool / material stockouts (zero tolerance; log incident if occurs).

## Weekly Synthesis
- Compile dashboard snapshot with trend lines for production, quality, safety, and attendance.
- Summarize top 3 wins, top 3 issues, and actions taken/required.
- Validate vendor performance (transport, disposal, housing) and escalate gaps.
- Update leadership brief with recommendations for next-week adjustments.
