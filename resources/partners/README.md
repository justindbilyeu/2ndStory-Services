# Partner Briefs

Partner briefs help us run fast, consistent outreach sprints. Each brief packages the why, who, and how for a specific organization so any teammate can pick up the thread without digging through notes.

## Workflow
1. **Scan the index** to confirm priority and check the last update date.
2. **Open the brief** before any outreach touchpoint. Skim the executive summary and contact card, then review the latest talking points and timing cues.
3. **Log updates** directly in the brief (Sources + Last Updated stamp) and refresh the index entry.
4. **Score changes** after each major interaction so prioritization stays current.

## Scoring Rubric
We use a simple 0–5 priority score to focus effort:

| Dimension | Score | Description |
|-----------|:-----:|-------------|
| **Reach** | 0–2 | 0: unclear path to candidates · 1: indirect or limited channel · 2: strong line of sight to qualified workers |
| **Fit** | 0–2 | 0: mission misaligned · 1: partial alignment or open questions · 2: clear alignment with 2nd Story crews |
| **Responsiveness** | 0–1 | 0: slow/no replies · 1: responsive or warm intro |

**Priority** = Reach + Fit + Responsiveness. Scores 4–5 are Sprint-ready, 2–3 are Nurture, 0–1 go into Monitor.

## Maintenance
- Update briefs weekly during active sprints.
- Archive inactive partners by moving their brief to `/resources/partners/archive/` and keeping the index entry for historical context.
- Keep sources transparent. Link to emails, call notes, and wiki pages so others can verify quickly.
