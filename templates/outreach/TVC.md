**Subject:** Quick touchpoint on Village Collaborative build-out

Hi Katharine,

Hope your week is off to a strong start. I’m touching base on the transitional tiny home village concept we mapped out with your operations team. We tightened the supply chain plan so that we can deliver the first 12 units inside of a six-week window once we get the green light.

Do you have availability this week for a short call to align on funding approvals and make sure the permitting path is still clear? Happy to send the updated milestone tracker in advance so you can share it internally.

Thanks again for the collaboration—excited to keep momentum going.

Warmly,
Justin
