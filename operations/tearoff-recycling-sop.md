# SOP — Clean Tear-Off for Recycling

## Goal
Produce **clean shingle loads** acceptable for recyclers; minimize contamination.

## Staging (separate containers)
1) Shingles only  2) Underlayment/felt  3) Metal/flashings  4) Wood/deck debris  5) Misc trash

## On-roof
- Remove caps → field shingles layer by layer
- Keep felt/wood/metal out of shingle container
- Magnetic sweep per section

## Ground check
- No wood, felt, plastic, paper in shingle bin
- Nails allowed if recycler accepts (confirm spec)
- Take 2 photos per load (top + side) → attach to job record

## Transport
- Cover loads; avoid rain contamination
- Save scale ticket + diversion receipt in job folder

## Fail-safe
If recycler rejects: divert to landfill, log reason, fix process at next job.
