Hands of Hope Outreach Submission — Please share the latest developments on your transitional housing projects, including:

- Confirmation that 2nd Story Services can provide modular units for the Q4 intake.
- Updated budget range (we can flex between $780k–$1.1M depending on the final amenities package).
- Preferred delivery timeline and any permitting constraints we should know about.
- Key contacts for facilities, procurement, and on-site services so we can coordinate the pre-install walkthrough.

We’re ready to move fast as soon as we get the approval—thanks for keeping us in the loop!
