# WOTC Setup & Workflow (2nd Story Services)

**Goal:** Capture federal Work Opportunity Tax Credits (WOTC) for eligible hires.

## Day 0 (Hire Date)
- Add **IRS Form 8850** to new-hire packet.
- Complete with employee; get signature **on or before** the job offer acceptance.
- Submit Form 8850 to the **state workforce agency** within **28 days** of the hire date (Texas: TWC WOTC).
- Log submission in `data/wotc-tracking.csv`.

## Eligibility Categories (common for us)
- **Veterans** (various criteria)
- **Reentry / felony within one year of conviction/release**
- **Public assistance (e.g., SNAP/TANF)**

## Track to Maximize Credit
- Credit scales with hours/wages:
  - ≥120 hours triggers partial credit
  - ≥400 hours enables maximum per-hire credit
- Track hours (initial 120, then 400) + wages in first year.

## Tax Time
- Use **Form 5884** to claim WOTC against income tax.
- Credits can carry back 1 year / forward up to 20 years (subject to current rules).
- Maintain documentation: 8850, certification, hours, wages.

## Operational Tips
- Put 8850 into your digital onboarding checklist.
- Send a weekly digest of hires to verify all 28-day submissions were done.
- Coordinate with your tax preparer early (Q1) to ensure full capture.
